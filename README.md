### [MYFDIR Guided Projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OirFGI-34Ko&list=PLG6KGSNK4PuBWmX9NykU0wnWamjxdKhDJ&index=22)

<h2>Description</h2>
Implemented a cutting-edge SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) and EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) solution within a home lab environment using LimaCharlie and Tines. This project focuses on automating incident response, enhancing threat detection, and streamlining workflows to emulate real-world security operations and provide hands-on experience in modern cybersecurity practices.

<h2>Objective Overview</h2>
To build expertise in automating security operations and enhancing endpoint security by leveraging LimaCharlie and Tines. The goal is to design an efficient and scalable solution that reduces response time, improves threat visibility, and demonstrates proficiency in deploying SOAR and EDR technologies in practical scenarios.

<h2>Skills Learned</h2>

  - SOAR Implementation: Designed and automated workflows using Tines for incident response and security event management.
  - EDR Configuration: Deployed LimaCharlie to monitor, analyze, and respond to endpoint activity.
  - Threat Detection and Analysis: Improved skills in identifying and mitigating advanced threats through endpoint telemetry.
  - Automation Scripting: Created automated processes for alerting, containment, and remediation of threats.
  - Incident Response: Developed end-to-end workflows to handle security incidents quickly and effectively.
  - Data Integration: Integrated multiple tools and data sources to centralize threat intelligence and streamline security operations.
  - Security Orchestration: Coordinated tasks between various tools and technologies to achieve seamless response mechanisms.
  - Problem Solving: Troubleshot and optimized configurations for SOAR and EDR components.

<h2>Tools Used</h2>

  - LimaCharlie: For endpoint detection and response, telemetry collection, and threat monitoring.
  - Tines: For creating and automating security workflows to orchestrate incident responses.
